# Project for Unit 3 of the Codecademy Build websites from Scratch course

This web-site was is built as part of Unit 3 in the course.
Completion not only required advanced style notes, but proper usage of the git work flow.


Everything is fixed and up to date. The project can be considered finalized.

Still to do: establish a better file hierarchy with respect to other repositories
