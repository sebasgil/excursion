# Project for Unit 3 of the Codecademy Build websites from Scratch course

This web-site was is built as part of Unit 3 in the course.
Completion not only required advanced style notes, but proper usage of the git work flow.


NOTE: Although all the pushes have worked, the GitHub pages link seems to be broken. Wait for server maintenance, perhaps?
